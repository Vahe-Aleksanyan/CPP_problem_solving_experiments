This C++ program implements the gradient descent algorithm with Armijo backtracking line search to find the minimum point of a given objective function. The objective function and its gradient are defined manually. The Armijo backtracking algorithm dynamically adjusts the step size during each iteration to ensure convergence towards the minimum point. For the provided example, the algorithm successfully finds the minimum point to be [ 1.13378 𝑒 − 05 , 0 ] [1.13378e−05,0] after 12 iterations. The stopping criterion for the algorithm is a tolerance of 1 0 − 3 10 −3 for the norm of the gradient.
