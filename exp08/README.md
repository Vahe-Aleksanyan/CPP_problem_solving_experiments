This C++ program implements the Gauss-Seidel iterative method to solve a system of linear equations 𝐴 𝑥 = 𝑏 Ax=b. The program validates the input matrix 𝐴 A to ensure it is square and that the vector 𝑏 b has a matching length. The initial solution vector 𝑥 x is initialized to zeros and iteratively updated based on the Gauss-Seidel formula. For the provided example, with matrix 𝐴 A and vector 𝑏 b, the solution vector 𝑥 x is found to be [ 2 , 2 , 2 ] [2,2,2] after 50 iterations. The program performs all matrix and vector operations manually without relying on external libraries.
