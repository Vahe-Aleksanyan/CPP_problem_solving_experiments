### LU Factorization Solver

This C++ program implements the LU factorization method to solve a system of linear equations \( Ax = b \). The LU factorization decomposes matrix \( A \) into a lower triangular matrix \( L \) and an upper triangular matrix \( U \). The program then solves the system using forward and backward substitution. The provided example matrix \( A \) and vector \( b \) yield the solution vector \( x \) as \([1, -1, 1, -1]\). This implementation performs all matrix operations manually without relying on external libraries, ensuring a clear understanding of the LU factorization process and its computational steps
