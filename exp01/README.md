This project demonstrates the implementation of the bisection method and the analysis of sequence convergence using C++. The bisection method is applied to find roots of nonlinear functions within specified intervals. We also explore three iterative sequences to examine different types of convergence behavior: quadratic, linear, and sublinear. Sequence A converges quadratically, quickly stabilizing to a precise value. Sequence B demonstrates linear convergence, with the error reducing gradually over iterations. Sequence C shows sublinear convergence, with a slower progression towards its limit. This project provides a foundational understanding of numerical methods and sequence behavior without relying on external libraries.
