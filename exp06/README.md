The integration results for f1 f2 and f3 vary across different methods and subdivisions. For f1, the Trapezoid Rule consistently gives zero, while Simpson's Rule produces small but non-zero results. Gauss Quadrature Rule offers larger values, suggesting better accuracy. For f2 , Trapezoid and Simpson's Rules provide similar outcomes, but Gauss Quadrature yields notably higher values. Similarly, for  f3, Trapezoid and Simpson's Rules are close, but Gauss Quadrature gives substantially larger results. These comparisons highlight the importance of method selection based on function characteristics and desired precision.
